In this project, we conducted sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews data. Users have the option to either upload a document containing review data or input text directly into the provided field to analyze sentiment. We employed several models including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Trees, with the XGBoost model demonstrating the highest accuracy. The web application was developed using Flask and is operational on localhost:5000.
